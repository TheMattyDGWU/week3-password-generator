# week3-password-generator
When clicking a button to create a new password, the user is prompted with password criteria,
such as upper/lower case, length, and type of characters.

Length must be between 8 - 128 characters.
Character types must include uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

Input should be validated and at least ONE character type should be selected after all prompts are answered.

Password is then generated that matches the selected criteria, which is then either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
